This is an unofficial Swift package giving you a few options to query Dresden's public transport system for current bus- and tramstop data.

Want something like this for another language, look [no further](https://github.com/kiliankoe/vvo#libraries) ðŸ™‚



## Example

WIP



## Installation

DVB is available through Cocoapods, Carthage/Punic and Swift Package Manager, take your pick.

Copypasta for your Podfile:

```ruby
pod 'DVB'
```

Cartfile:

```
github "kiliankoe/DVB"
```

Package.swift:

```swift
.Package(url: "https://github.com/kiliankoe/DVB", majorVersion: 2)
```



## Quick Start

Be sure to check the [docs](http://cocoadocs.org/docsets/DVB) for more detailed information on how to use this library, but here are some quick examples for getting started right away.

### Monitor a single stop

Monitor a single stop to see every bus, tram or whatever leaving this stop. The necessary stop id can be found by using the `find()` function.

```swift
Departure.monitor(id: "33000037") { response in
    // do something with the list of departures in response.departures
}
```

### Find a specific stop

Say you're looking for "Zellescher Weg". You can use the following to find a selection of stops.

```swift
Stop.find(query: "HelmholtzstraÃŸe") { response in
	// do something with the list of stops in response.stops
}
```
